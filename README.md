# Django REST API with One-Time-Password

This repository is the implementation of a basic REST API designed for an android app. The API is a part of my final project for my "Software Analysis and Design" course.

I've used the **Django Rest Framework** library for setting up the REST interface to the modules, and used the **Python OTP** for handling the authentication procedures.
There are tons of great libraries for Django that can automatically incorporate OTP authentication into its systems, but configuring them seemed to take much longer than just implementing the simple procedures I require for my project! Perhaps a bit over-generalized?!

*This repository is still a work in progress.*
